# sand
`sand` is for creating interpreters, like the Python interpreter and Haskell interpreter.
It can also be used for creating text based games and CLI test environments.

For examples, check out the [examples](https://github.com/Zaba505/sand/tree/master/example) folder.

#### Design
`sand` implements a concurrent model. It views an interpreter as two seperate components:
the User Interface, `sand.UI`, and the Command Processor,`sand.Engine`. The following
diagram shows how under the hood `sand` operates. Every square is a goroutine.

`sand.UI` is a `struct` that is provided for you and is implemented as broad as possible;
however there are few features missing, which are commonly found in popular interpreters,
namely: Line history and Auto-completion. These features may be added later, but as for
now they are not planned for.

`sand.Engine` is an `interface`, which must be implemented by the user. Implementations
of `sand.Engine` must have a comparable underlying type, see [Go Spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Comparison_operators)
for comparable types in Go.
